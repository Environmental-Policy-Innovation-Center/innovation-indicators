"https://github.com/noaa-pifsc/PIFSC-DataValidationModule","The Data Validation Module (DVM) was developed to provide a framework to validate data entered in the database based on flexible data validation criteria that can be developed and implemented in Oracle Views by a data manager/developer without requiring application development skills.  A series of QC Views can be developed to identify problematic values in the database and implemented in the framework to allow each criteria to be evaluated on the given data stream.","PLSQL",67,"2016-12-15T23:18:15Z","2024-04-04T02:52:48Z",1,"JAbdul-PIFSC","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration","NOAA-PIFSC"
"https://github.com/noaa-pifsc/PIFSC-DBVersionControlModule","The Database Version Control Module (VCM) was developed to provide a safe and easy way to install and upgrade database modules deployed on a given Oracle database instance.  The VCM provides information on which database module versions were installed and when they were installed on a database instance.  This module is used to apply the necessary database upgrades in the correct order to upgrade a given database module to a desired version.","PLSQL",48,"2020-08-12T21:00:59Z","2024-04-02T19:20:26Z",1,"JAbdul-PIFSC","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration","NOAA-PIFSC"
