"https://github.com/nasa/OpenMDAO-Framework","OpenMDAO is an open-source Multidisciplinary Design Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) framework, written in Python. It helps users solve complex problems by allowing them to link together analysis codes from multiple disciplines at multiple levels of fidelity.  The development effort for OpenMDAO is being led out of the NASA Glenn Research Center in the MDAO branch. The development effort is being funded by the Fundamental Aeronautic Program, Subsonic Fixe Wing project. The ultimate goal is to provide a flexible common analysis platform that can be shared between industry, academia, and government.","Python, Fortran, HTML, C, Shell, Makefile",13227,"2008-10-23T13:15:10Z","2015-05-06T13:42:26Z",20,"naylor-b, Kenneth-T-Moore, swryan, setowns1, JustinSGray, hschilling, justinopenmdao, pziegfeld, thearn, pyvelepor, cnkavanaugh, tgrzincic, kmarsteller, cwmine, jcchin, relf, dykeag, eshendricks, fzahle, andrewning","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","NASA"

It includes an engineering unit aware math library. libSPRITE includes a task scheduling system that abstracts pthreads and includes a publish subscribe data system for data routing. In addition, libSPRITE includes an optional binding to the Lua scripting language for configuring the program, setting parameters, running Lua scripts within C++ tasks and even interacting with the application during runtime.","C++, Lua, CMake, C, Makefile, Python",200,"2014-03-29T11:04:02Z","2016-05-04T18:04:22Z",4,"MichaelRFairhurst, dheater, jasonduley, sutt0n","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","NASA"

"https://github.com/nasa/TSAT","The Thermal Systems Analysis Toolbox (TSAT) is a MATLAB/Simulink based tool for modeling and analysis of dynamic thermal systems involving heat transfer. It is best suited for 1-D and 2-D heat transfer involving solid planar and cylindrical structures, however, the toolset is more extensive than this. The tools enable consideration of conduction, convection, and radiation boundary conditions. Some advanced capabilities are provided when it comes to approximating conduction within non-isotropic materials, structures with material transitions, and structures with time-varying temperature dependent material properties. Numerous tools are available to facilitate the construction of modular models of thermal systems and their integration with larger system models.","HTML, MATLAB, M",3,"2018-06-22T16:56:34Z","2018-06-22T17:53:22Z",1,"jkratz","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","NASA"

The software allows the user to perform an automated uncertainty analysis for any given computational code without requiring modification to the source. UQPCE estimates sensitivities, confidence intervals, and other model statistics, which can be useful in the conceptual design and analysis of flight vehicles.
